            <p>Moms First is a registered community-based organization in Kiambu County. It was formed to provide mental health resources for new moms and their families</p>
            <h3>Why Moms First</h3>
            <p>“Nobody really tells you the truth about motherhood."</p>
            <p>This is something that many new mothers feel, and relate to. The truth is, that no matter how much you read about the sleep deprivation, the witching hours, and the lack of what used to be essential personal grooming (there are still days I don’t shower), it’s not really believable until you’re the one in your pajamas from the previous day, microwaving your coffee for the third time while you try to measure formula powder through barely-open eyes or attempt to unhook your nursing bra only to remember you aren’t wearing one. We see others with their babies out at the grocery store or library and think they look great. They probably even ate breakfast. And we think we are the only mom who is fumbling and faking their way through a new life.</p>
            <p>Being a mom? Is HARD.  And that is why Moms First is putting together resources to help new mothers and their families.</p>

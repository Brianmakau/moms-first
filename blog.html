    <h1>Practical ways to get involved in Maternal Mental Health Awareness</h1>
    <p>May is Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month. All of this month, organizations all over the world join efforts
      in raising awareness on maternal mental health issues so that more women will get the treatment they need, and
      fewer will suffer in silence. This, according to the World Maternal Mental Health Day website is so that women
      living with perinatal mental health conditions can get the help they need.</p>

    <h2>PPDKenya engagement in the #MaternalMHMatters awareness campaign</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>On social media by sharing content that highlights maternal mental health issues under the hashtags
        #MaternalMHMatters and #MomsFirst </li>
      <li>Sharing personal stories of Kenyan moms who have lived with a maternal mental illness, received help and made
        a recovery/are recovering.</li>
      <li>Through a photo project in partnership with Picha Sabuni Photography, dubbed Mother’s Mind. Mother’s Mind is a
        project that depicts the emotions that mothers with a mental illness go through, in a bid to reduce the stigma
        and discrimination that comes with maternal mental illness.</li>

    <h1>Moms share 5 things they wish they knew about mental health</h1>
    <img src="images/5things.jpg" alt="what I wish i knew">
    <p>
      Many new moms often experience changes in their mental health in the period after birth. Postpartum Depression
      (PPD) is one of the most common maternal mental illnesses; with statistics showing that 1 in every 9 moms will get
      PPD. Yet, as common as it is, many affected moms typically admit that they wish they knew more about PPD before
      they had it. They admit it would help them accept the condition and seek help faster. We asked some of the moms
      who have reached out to PPDKenya (and gotten help) what they wish they knew about PPD before child birth. Here are
      the responses:
    <ol>
      <li>I wish I knew PPD steals even little joys
        <br><br>
        Lyn, a mom of two girls, shared how her PPD stole even the smallest of triumphs. She could not find joy in her
        motherhood experience, and this impacted her ability to bond with her second daughter. One of the ways in which
        Postpartum Depression manifests is through a mom’s inability to bond with her child. This does not mean that a
        mom hates her child; on the contrary, she may be overprotective of her bundle of joy, but just can’t find it
        within herself to bond and play with her baby.
      </li>
      <li>I wish I knew PPD is a treatable mental illness
        <br><br>
        Lucy, a mom to one said, “I wish I knew Postpartum Depression is a mental health condition that can be treated
        through therapy. “ One of the myths about PPD is that it is a permanent condition for which there is no help.
        PPD is a temporary condition for which treatment is available. Moms do get help, and go on to make a recovery.
        Part of the reason we continue to do awareness campaigns on Twitter (check out our previous #PPDKenya tweetchats
        here) is because when moms are aware, then they can know what the symptoms of PPD are and where to get help.
      </li>
      <li>
        Victoria* shared and said, “I am afraid of telling anyone close what’s happening anymore, because the last time
        I tried I was told that I have become ungrateful, so I continue to struggle with my PPD in silence. I feel so
        alone.”
      </li>
    </ol>
    The stigma associated with maternal mental illness means that moms feel ashamed for seeking help, and end up keeping
    it to themselves. The truth is that there is no shame in reaching out for help, and if you have PPD, please know you
    are not alone! At Moms First, we understand what you are going through. We are here to walk the journey with you. We
    will help you get the help you need. Get in touch.

    <h1>When new moms cannot bond with their babies</h1>
    <p>
      Violet (not her real name) remembers vividly her pregnancy journey and birth experience. She recalls with
      nostalgia, the excitement she had when she saw the two lines on the pregnancy test. Almost immediately, she began
      fantasizing about the small onesies, the colourful bibs, the stocking up of diapers and the love that would
      surround her once her beautiful baby arrived.
      <br><br>
      As time went by, Violet could not help it. She was so excited and couldn’t wait to see her baby’s face. She
      imagined how she’d arrive in hospital looking prim and proper, have a seamless birth and leave looking just as
      beautiful with her tiny tot swaddled in warm blankets. She imagined getting home, looking at baby lovingly and
      rocking him to sleep on quiet nights.
      <br><br>
      A few days before her EDD, Violet went into labour and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. The moment he was
      placed in her arms, Violet shared, she felt an odd sensation. She didn’t feel that magical bond on first sight. “I
      was grateful to have had a safe birth, but when he was placed in my arms, I was shocked that the mythical magical
      bond was just not there. It felt odd, because while everyone was gushing about how adorable he was, I was
      frightened on the inside. He looked so small, and I wondered how my life would change with him in it.”
      <br><br>
      Violet would go on to get discharged from hospital and fight with the thought that she found it hard to bond with
      her baby. “Where was that instant bond I thought I would have with my son? How come I was struggling at the time?
      I did not hate my baby, I just couldn’t create the bond I always fantasized about when I was pregnant,” she
      disclosed.

      Postpartum bonding, according to the Baby Center website, refers to the strong attachment a new mom develops with
      her baby. It makes a new mom want to show love and affection to her baby. It is what would make a mom take a
      bullet for her baby.

      For some moms, this happens immediately after birth when the baby is handed over for skin-to-skin contact. For
      other moms, it takes a few days after birth, and yet for others a little longer than that, sometimes running up to
      a month or so postpartum. Part of the reason for this is that mother-infant bonding is an individual experience.
      It is an unfolding process because both the new mom and newborn are learning on the go.

      The new mom is learning to nurse, to lull the baby to sleep, to care for the baby and even create a distinction
      between different cries- discomfort cries, I-need-to-be-changed cry, pain cries, hunger cries and everything in
      between. The new baby on the other hand, is adjusting to life outside the comfort of the womb. This can be
      exhausting, and may slow down the process of bonding.

      In addition to this, some moms who are unable to bond with their babies may be suffering from Postpartum
      Depression (PPD). Often linked to the sudden drop in hormonal levels, PPD, combined with the stress of been a new
      mom therefore, makes it harder for moms to bond with the baby. Other related symptoms include:
      <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>a sense of hopelessness that the inability to bond with baby will last forever</li>
      <li>Anxiety that a poor bond makes one a bad mom</li>
      <li>Excessive moodiness</li>
      <li>Feeling overwhelmed especially after using social media where the images painted of new moms reflect the
        magical bond</li>
      <li>In some cases, thoughts of causing harm to the mom/ the baby</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Violet went on to get help to assist her with her motherhood experience, alongside the support offered by her
    partner and family. Below are some suggestions to help new moms bond with their baby. While this is not a magic
    formula, it does help ease the journey.
    <ul>
      <li>Take time for skin-to-skin contact during cuddle time as this is both soothing and relaxing for the baby.</li>
      <li>Breastfeeding often has also been shown to enhance wellness and allow feelings of attachment for the mom.</li>
      <li>Look into the baby’s eyes, as you talk and sing to him. Play with him daily to help forge the bond. Some moms
        will find that reading also helps with bonding.</li>
      <li>Join a new mommy group to help you through the journey, and you will be amazed at how many other moms feel the
        same way you do.</li>
    </ul>
